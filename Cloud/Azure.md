### Create a virtual network:
- Create Vnet name: tech501-maram-2-subnet-vnet
- Create 2 subnets ; a public and private
    - public subnet : 10.0.1.0/24 ~ 256 IPs
    - Private subnet: 10.0.3.0/24 ~ 256 IPs
- paste your public .ssh key pair.(ensure private is kept secret).

- Size: Standard_B1s â€” 1 vcpu, 1 GiB [very important to set correctly because this impacts pricing]
- Administrator account: adminuser
- Use existing key pair stored in Azure (use the one with your name)
- Select inbound ports: allow HTTP and SSH traffic
- Disks tab: disk type: Standard SSD
Networking tab:
- Virtual network: your named version
- Subnet: public-subnet
- Choose Delete public IP and NIC when VM is deleted option
- make sure to stop VM when logged off. 


### Connect local machine to VM:
- from vm select connect and choose Native ssh connect.
- paste the pathway of the private key.
- paste the address into git and type yes. 


### when deleting VM delete:
- disk
- network interface
- security group
