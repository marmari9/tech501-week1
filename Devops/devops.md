# T-shaped professional:

- Most important skills for future proof:
    - **Communication and collaboration** with other teams members and developers.
    - Use generative **AI**.
    - **Adaptability**.


# Countinuos improvement:
  -  what is going to **create buisness value**.
  - How we help the buisness grow.
  - minimize the amount of work in progress (through agile having a certain number of tasks in progress); limit the amount of work in progress. as long as the developer are working on the code and the features are not realesed then end users are not .
  - accelerate software development as long as the code is not in progress it has no value for the buisness.
  - Junior devops will focus more on monitoring, maybe deploy a feature not a whole app. as senior you will have more deployment of an application.
  - anything with agile, expect **daily stand ups** and explore the blockers.
  - Retro meetings; explore what went well with the process and how to improve processes.
  - Security must be built in from the begining. 
  - DevSecOps: think about all related to security and reliability.
